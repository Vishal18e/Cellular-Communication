# Simulations
There are simulations related to channel estimation, OFDM-MIMO
receiver and also beamformers.

## LS-LMMSE Channel Estimation
The two channel estimators are compared and we clearly see that at lower SNR LMMSE estimators overperforms LS channel estimator.
This validates the theoratical results as well.





In this simulation the two type of the receivers are compared and we can 
easily see that the Maximum likelihood receiver overperforms the
